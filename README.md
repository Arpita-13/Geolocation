# Geolocation
Python+SQL project using the OpenStreetMap API with the database and data visualization on OpenStreetMap.
In this project, we use the free OpenStreetMap API (Nominatim service) to 
convert university names entered by users into geographical locations,
and then we place the processed data on the OpenStreetMap map.
